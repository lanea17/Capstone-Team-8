    <h2>MONTH ONE</h2>
    <p>During Month One, our team spent the beginning of the month understanding the scope
      of our project. Dr. Stiffler was able to introduce us to the idea of a POS (Point of Sale) system, 
      and we narrowed down what this design could look like. Minor details like types of data we could 
      test with, ideas for databases, and even the tech stack possibilities were discussed in this first meeting.

        <h3>Schema Creation</h3>
        <p>Began formulating our schema that would ultimately be the test data for our databases/inventory.</p>

      <div class="step">
        <h3>Database Testing</h3>
        <p>The previous Capstone I database, which used MongoDB, was tested and showed several flaws and disadvantages. 
            The schema that had been created earlier was used for the testing. Then, a new database technology, Neo4J, 
            was tested based on Dr. Stiffler's recommendation. Neo4J turned out to be much easier to use, with visual 
            data representation that made analysis simpler. Although the final decision on the database hadn't been fully made, 
            Neo4J was fully developed and was expected to be the go-to choice for the POS system.</p>

    <h2>MONTH TWO</h2>
    <p>In Month Two, our team found its rhythm after a somewhat irregular start in Month One. With more consistent 
      team meetings and a few check-ins with our client, Dr. Stiffler, we were able to align on project expectations 
      and make significant progress.

      <div class="step">
        <h3>Database Development</h3>
        <p>We focused on building a working SQLite3 database and Python script that could be run on all team members' devices. 
          The script rebuilds the database on each run, enabling easy updates. With the help of Dr. Stiffler’s GitHub scripts, 
          and after learning how to use SQLite and Pandas, we successfully created and displayed the database using two scripts. 
          This allowed us to view data in a clean table format and ensure consistent local copies across all machines.</p>

        <h3>UI Prototyping with Figma</h3>
        <p>Front-end development took place alongside backend work. Using Figma, we created several application screen 
          mockups. Figma's intuitive tools and educational development features allowed us to convert designs into 
          usable code for our stylesheets and front-end files within the repository.</p>

      <div class="step">
        <h3>Front-End Integration</h3>
        <p>After confirming database-to-browser connectivity, we evolved from a basic black-screen text display to a 
          structured button layout inspired by our Figma designs. This layout introduced a hierarchy that mirrored the 
          simplicity of platforms like Toast. We then implemented features such as a search bar, a dynamic receipt display, 
          subtotal/tax/total calculators, and automatic tip buttons—all styled with CSS based on our Figma designs.</p>
