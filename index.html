    <h2>MONTH ONE: Design, Database Creation, Tech Stack</h2>
    <p>During Month One, our team spent the beginning of the month understanding the scope
      of our project. Dr. Stiffler was able to introduce us to the idea of a POS (Point of Sale) system, 
      and we narrowed down what this design could look like. Minor details like types of data we could 
      test with, ideas for databases, and even the tech stack possibilities were discussed in this first meeting.
    </p>

        <h3>Schema Creation</h3>
        <p>Began formulating our schema that would ultimately be the test data for our databases/inventory.</p>

      <div class="step">
        <h3>Database Testing</h3>
        <p>The previous Capstone I database, which used MongoDB, was tested and showed several flaws and disadvantages. 
            The schema that had been created earlier was used for the testing. Then, a new database technology, Neo4J, 
            was tested based on Dr. Stiffler's recommendation. Neo4J turned out to be much easier to use, with visual 
            data representation that made analysis simpler. Although the final decision on the database hadn't been fully made, 
            Neo4J was fully developed and was expected to be the go-to choice for the POS system.</p>
